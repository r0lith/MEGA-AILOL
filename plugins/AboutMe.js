  const bio = `ðŸ“š *About Me:*

Iâ€™m Rolith, 25 years old, and someone who genuinely enjoys meeting new people and hanging out. I love being around others, sharing time and conversations, and I find a lot of joy in building connections. Iâ€™m also the community admin for We The Barodians, a WhatsApp group for my city, where I stay involved and connected with people around me.

Traveling has been a big part of my life since 2021. Iâ€™ve been solo traveling to different places, which has helped me grow personally and discover more about myself and the world. While I live in Vadodara, I often travel to Delhi for study purposes as well.

Alongside my job, Iâ€™m pursuing two degrees through open distance learning. It keeps me busy, but I enjoy learning and growing in different directions at the same time. I also love tech, and Iâ€™ve been deeply interested in AI â€” Iâ€™ve been working on my own AI project for over a year now.

In the past, Iâ€™ve worked as a pre-alpha and alpha tester for various games and have done some white hat work too. I know and work with multiple coding languages including JavaScript, Core Java, HTML, CSS, C, C++, and Pawn. Iâ€™ve also created my own WhatsApp bot using JavaScript and the Baileys library, which has been one of my favorite personal projects.
